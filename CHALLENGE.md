# Trustly Technical Challenge - System Integration Engineer

## Challenge 1:
The challenge is to find a way to use the API (http://worldclockapi.com/): It could be a simple page (you don't need to care about design or layout), some curl's examples or Postman's documentation.

### Requirements:
- You need to display the results on screen;
- You need to use JavaScript or related programing language (i.e. NodeJS, ReactJS and others);
- We must understand your code and use your API without having to ask you any questions. Our primary language is English so please use it on comments and documentation;
- We’d like to see SOLID principles in your solution;
- You don’t need to persist any data (but feel free to do it if you want);

## Challenge 2:
Create a Java class to print your name, nationality and biggest dream.

### Requirements:
- You need to display the results on screen;
- You need to use Java;
- You don’t need to persist any data (but feel free to do it if you want);
